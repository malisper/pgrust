//! Seam declarations for the `backend-utils-cache-relcache` unit
//! (`utils/cache/relcache.c`), which owns relcache entries (`RelationData`)

//!
//! The owning unit installs these from its `init_seams()` when it lands; until
//! then a call panics loudly. Open relations cross as their `Oid`; the
//! relcache resolves the OID back to the live entry.
